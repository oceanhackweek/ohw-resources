<h2 id="how-will-the-projects-be-conducted">How will the projects be conducted?</h2>
<p>We have put together the <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Q71S1Rae7U_V5BrcSBOiXU1VvNmv7wsjNKBdG5wCEv0/edit">Project proposal form</a> that includes a list of questions that walk you through the few things to consider while setting up a project. Feel free to bounce ideas and form groups in the <code>#ohw21_project</code> channel prior to the event, and submit the proposal form when you think you/your team is ready.</p>
<p>On Tuesday August 3 we will have a brief “project setup” session for an overview of all projects already proposed up to that point, and give another opportunity to pitch new ideas that may be formed throughout the day. The deadline to submit project proposals is 3pm PDT / 6pm EDT / 22:00 UTC that day.</p>
<h2 id="tips-for-getting-started">Tips for getting started</h2>
<ul>
<li>Potentially choose something that you've been interested but haven't had the time or skills to do before, or something you can continue to work on post OceanHackWeek!</li>
<li>Hacking is a community activity! It's okay to choose projects that you can't accomplish alone as other people will be there to help you, both at OceanHackWeek and outside of it!</li>
<li>Help your group member: you might be the person they need to solve their problem, and vice versa.</li>
<li>When discussing, pitch your explanation to the least experienced hacker in the group, and you'll end up better understanding what you're trying to do, or need to revise your idea.</li>
<li>You can mix programming languages as needed in order to get started, but do check in with your project mentors and group members to make sure your efforts are straightforward to be absorbed into the project.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="see-projects-from-previous-years">See projects from previous years:</h2>
<p>The links below lead to project lists from past OceanHackWeek events, including links to GitHub repositories and video presentations.</p>

<li><a href="https://oceanhackweek.github.io/ohw2018/projects.html">OHW18 project list</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="creating-a-github-repository-for-your-project">Creating a GitHub repository for your project</h2>
<p>Once a project moves forward, please create a GitHub repository for the project in the OceanHackWeek GitHub organization <a href="https://github.com/oceanhackweek/">https://github.com/oceanhackweek/</a>, following this format for project name: <code>ohw21-proj-myprojectname</code> (you can change the name later), where <code>myprojectname</code> is a brief name for your project. Go to the <a href="../../prep/git/#git-steps-and-workflows">Git steps and workflows section</a> on the <code>Git</code> page in this web site for detailed instructions on how to create the repository and collaborate with project team members using git and GitHub.</p>
<!-- * Start with ideas that are close to home: your research, a project for your company, something you have always been interested in. -->
<!-- * Start with one simple idea first, and when it is built add complexity afterwards. -->
<!-- * Help your neighbor: you might be the person they need to solve their problem, and vice versa. -->

Below are OHW19 materials: some can be revived for future in-person events, so keeping them here as comments.

<!-- ## How will the projects be conducted?

* On day 1 we will facilitate the sharing of ideas and formation of people into small teams (2-5 people)
* Once formed, each team will be guided through exercises to help narrow in on a set of tasks that are doable within the 5 days. A brief project outline will be posted to GitHub, following the "Project Guidelines" below.


## What can I do to prepare in advance?

* If you have a project idea already brewing, we encourage you to share that with the team on the #project channel on Slack. We can add additional channels as the project ideas develop.
* Feel free to explore various projects and initiate conversations. The goal is to gather as much information as you can to inform your decision about which team to join when we meet in person.
* Contact an Oceanhackweek organizer if you would like assistance in assessing whether a project is well-scoped, or if you need help with a particular dataset. 


## OceanHackWeek specifics

* Who are you going to hack with? Here's [a list of your fellow hackers](participants_2019)
* What are you going to work on? [Project guidelines and ideas](project_guidelines)
* Start pitching ideas on our [#projects slack](https://oceanhackweek2019.slack.com) channel, and then once projects materialize, we can migrate to a separate project channel
* Begin populating an Oceanhackweek GitHub project page - instructions coming soon
