# Project Overview

**STILL NEED TO REVISE THIS**

## Purpose of the projects

During Oceanhackweek we will be facilitating open hacking sessions most of the afternoons. The purpose of these sessions is for you to gain hands-on experience in working together on a well-defined problem related to oceanographic sciences.

## What is hacking?

Hacking is a session of focused, highly collaborative computer programming, in which we create conditions for rapid absorption of new ideas and methods. Visit our [hacking central](Hacking-Central) page for more specific information on this approach.

## Why is this important?

Increasingly, research and software development is being conducted across groups of people with diverse skills and backgrounds. We believe this collaborative work leads to more innovative solutions to complex problems. At oceanhackweek, our goal is to explore with you some of the skills needed to navigate technical and social challenges of working in these kinds of collaborative settings.

## How will the projects be conducted?

* On day 1 we will facilitate the sharing of ideas and formation of people into small teams (2-5 people)
* Once formed, each team will be guided through exercises to help narrow in on a set of tasks that are doable within the 5 days. A brief project outline will be posted to GitHub, following the "Project Guidelines" below.

## What can I do to prepare in advance?

* If you have a project idea already brewing, we encourage you to share that with the team on the #project channel on Slack. We can add additional channels as the project ideas develop.
* Feel free to explore various projects and initiate conversations. The goal is to gather as much information as you can to inform your decision about which team to join when we meet in person.
* Contact an Oceanhackweek organizer if you would like assistance in assessing whether a project is well-scoped, or if you need help with a particular dataset.
